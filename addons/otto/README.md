A note to anyone looking to add this.

This is not at all in a stable state. If you want to know the commands available at any given time, you'll have a better time
finding the most up-to-date version in otto_events until it stabilizes.

In order to run, this requires lor/libs  https://github.com/lorand-ffxi/lor_libs

Those should go one directory up into ../libs/lor_libs

Dunno who the guy is but he wrote a lot of extremely useful code. Same with Ivaar. If I get anywhere near a stable version for this, it will be mostly 
off of what he has done from those libs and healbot.


-- todo\ 
singer?\
    things I don't like about singer
    when you die it completely fucks everything
    very often gets out of whack from using timers
    doesn't know when buffs miss
    
    things I like about singer
    waits until everyone is in range.
    good support for using an ability + an action (pianissimo + ballad)

add comments for names on the resists?

Bugs
geo-preactions are fucking up magic bursts.
dispel false isn't working for first time on new mobs
dispel is spamming when 'no effect' happens
backline roles are drawing weapons using pull
fix whm erase-ga (it's breaking buffs because of prioritization.) -- maybe fixed?
clean up vprint logs
weaponskill / magicburst carries to new target.
make queue more efficient
add checks -- aspir is targeting any target
maybe curaga deciding could use a bit of touch up?

TODO
aspir is targeting any target -- offensive action need better conditions for performing
add global on / off
bug in assist for backline roles. -- offensive action need better conditions for performing
gearswap not swapping rings.
white should tick faster (cure is too slow sometimes seems like ~3-4 second delay)
