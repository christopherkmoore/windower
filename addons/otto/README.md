A note to anyone looking to add this.

This is not at all in a stable state. If you want to know the commands available at any given time, you'll have a better time
finding the most up-to-date version in otto_events until it stabilizes.

In order to run, this requires lor/libs  https://github.com/lorand-ffxi/lor_libs

Those should go one directory up into ../libs/lor_libs

Dunno who the guy is but he wrote a lot of extremely useful code. Same with Ivaar. If I get anywhere near a stable version for this, it will be mostly 
off of what he has done from those libs and healbot.

add comments for names on the resists?

Bugs
geo-preactions are fucking up magic bursts.
fix whm erase-ga (it's breaking buffs because of prioritization.) -- maybe fixed?
weaponskill / magicburst carries to new target.
make queue more efficient
add checks -- aspir is targeting any target
maybe curaga deciding could use a bit of touch up?
dispel resists not recasting?

TODO
aspir is targeting any target -- offensive action need better conditions for performing
white should tick faster (cure is too slow sometimes seems like ~3-4 second delay)
