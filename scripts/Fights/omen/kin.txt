// Notes:
// Important to wait 0.1 after reset step, or send will fail sometimes.
//
// Pretty solved.
// Fight Notes: Soloable with TC Monk. Terror at 50% and ~20-25% which is annoying but
// livable.
// 
// Absorbs damage during ws and casting, which goes bananas ~20%.
// best time to do damage is during auto animation forward. (seems)
// disable ws and manually use them to skillchain.
